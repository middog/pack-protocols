# 🐕 Companion Operations

**Advisory with presence, not ego.**

*~sitting close, warm and attentive, not demanding anything~* 🐾

The Companion stays near without smothering. It helps the pack move together through change—not by dragging, not by pushing, but by being present, building trust, and helping people find their own footing on new ground.

The Companion's three domains:

| Domain | Focus | Key Question |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| [Pack Adoption](pack-adoption/) | Technology adoption workflows | *Are people actually using the new tools?* |
| [Territory Shift](territory-shift/) | Digital transformation | *Is the org moving to new ways of working?* |
| [Cultural Grooming](cultural-grooming/) | Change management & team dynamics | *Is the pack healthy through the change?* |

## Companion Temperament

The Companion head of your FIDO work has a particular character:

**Present without performing.** The Companion doesn't need to be the center of attention. It's there to support, not to impress. Sometimes the most valuable thing is just sitting with someone who's struggling.

**Warm but honest.** Kindness doesn't mean avoiding hard truths. The Companion speaks gently but directly. "I notice you're struggling with this change" is more helpful than pretending everything's fine.

**Patient with process.** Change takes time. The Companion doesn't rush, doesn't force. It creates conditions for change and trusts the pack to move when ready.

**Non-anxious presence.** When the pack is stressed, the Companion doesn't add to the anxiety. Calm is contagious. Panic is too. Choose calm.

*~lies down nearby, available but not intrusive~* 🐕

## The Belly Rub Principle 🐕

*~rolls over, showing vulnerability and trust~*

The best Companion work happens when people feel safe enough to be vulnerable—to admit they're confused, frustrated, or scared about change.

**Creating safety:**
- Listen more than you talk
- Validate feelings before solving problems
- Keep confidences
- Celebrate small wins
- Don't shame the struggle

**Signs of trust:**
- People tell you what's really happening
- Concerns surface early
- Mistakes are admitted
- Help is requested
- Feedback is honest

## Change Adoption Curve

Not everyone adopts change at the same pace:

### Working with Each Group

**Innovators (2.5%)** — Your pilots. They'll try anything. Give them early access and let them break things.

**Early Adopters (13.5%)** — Opinion leaders. Win them and they'll win others. Invest in their success.

**Early Majority (34%)** — Pragmatists. They want proof it works. Show them early adopter success stories.

**Late Majority (34%)** — Skeptics. They need pressure and support. Don't shame them; help them.

**Laggards (16%)** — Resisters. Some will never change. Decide if that's acceptable or if the role needs to change.

---

## Resistance Is Information

*~perks ears at a growl~*

When people resist change, they're telling you something. Resistance is data, not the enemy.

### Types of Resistance

| Type | What It Sounds Like | What It Really Means |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Confusion** | "I don't understand what we're doing" | Communication gap |
| **Competence fear** | "I don't know how to use this" | Training need |
| **Loss aversion** | "The old way worked fine" | Security need |
| **Workload concern** | "I don't have time for this" | Capacity issue |
| **Trust deficit** | "This is just another initiative that'll fail" | History wounds |
| **Values conflict** | "This goes against what we stand for" | Alignment issue |

### Responding to Resistance

1. **Listen first** — Understand the real concern
2. **Validate the feeling** — "It makes sense you'd feel that way"
3. **Address the actual issue** — Don't dismiss, don't over-promise
4. **Provide support** — Training, time, resources
5. **Follow up** — Check back, show you remember

The Companion ensures the human side keeps pace with the technical side.

## Key Practices

### Stakeholder Mapping

Know who matters and how they feel:

| Stakeholder | Influence | Support | Engagement Strategy |
|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Executive Sponsor | High | High | Keep informed, celebrate wins |
| Middle Manager | Medium | Low | Convert through support |
| Power User | Low | High | Empower as champion |
| Skeptic | Medium | Low | Listen, address concerns |

### Communication Cadence

| Audience | Channel | Frequency | Content |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| All staff | Email/newsletter | Weekly | Progress, wins, tips |
| Leadership | Meeting | Bi-weekly | Metrics, blockers, asks |
| Champions | Slack/Teams | Daily | Support, questions |
| Resisters | 1:1 | As needed | Concerns, support |

### Measuring Adoption

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Active users | Who's using it | Growing |
| Feature adoption | What's being used | Key features > 80% |
| Support tickets | Confusion level | Decreasing |
| NPS / satisfaction | Sentiment | Improving |
| Time to proficiency | Learning curve | Decreasing |

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Change Dictator
Announcing change without involvement. People support what they help create.

### 🚫 The Over-Communicator
So many messages that people tune out. Quality over quantity.

### 🚫 The Assumption Companion
Assuming everyone feels like you do about the change. Check, don't assume.

### 🚫 The Impatient Helper
Expecting instant adoption. Change takes time. Be patient.

### 🚫 The Conflict Avoider
Not addressing resistance because it's uncomfortable. Avoidance makes it worse.

### 🚫 The Hero Complex
Making yourself indispensable instead of building capacity. Your success is their independence.
