# 🐩 Cultural Grooming

**Change Management & Team Dynamics**

*~gentle brushing, working out the tangles with care~* 🐕

Cultural Grooming is the ongoing care work that keeps teams healthy through change. Catching the tangles before they become mats. Noticing when someone's withdrawn. Creating space for honest conversation.

## The Core Truth

> **Culture is how people behave when no one's watching.**
> **You can't decree culture. You can only nurture it.**
> **Healthy teams absorb change; unhealthy teams shatter.**

## Burnout Prevention

Change work is exhausting. The Companion watches for burnout:

### Early Warning Signs

| Sign | What to Watch |
|------|---------------|
| **Cynicism increase** | Negative comments, disengagement |
| **Reduced effectiveness** | Same effort, worse outcomes |
| **Exhaustion** | Physical, emotional, cognitive fatigue |
| **Withdrawal** | Less participation, more silence |
| **Irritability** | Shorter temper, less patience |

### Prevention Strategies

- **Protect recovery time** — Transformation can't be sprint forever
- **Celebrate milestones** — Acknowledge progress, not just completion
- **Rotate heavy lifting** — Don't exhaust the same people
- **Model sustainable pace** — Leaders work reasonable hours visibly
- **Check in genuinely** — "How are you?" with space to answer honestly

## Psychological Safety

Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety is the #1 predictor of team success.

**Psychological safety means:**
- Safe to take risks
- Safe to ask questions
- Safe to admit mistakes
- Safe to offer ideas
- Safe to challenge

**Building safety:**
- Leader admits own mistakes first
- Thank people for raising concerns
- No punishment for honest failure
- Curiosity before judgment
- "What can we learn?" not "Who screwed up?"

## Facilitation Practices

### Retrospectives

Regular reflection builds improvement muscle:

**Format:**
1. What went well? (Celebrate)
2. What could improve? (Learn)
3. What will we try? (Commit)

**Cadence:** Every 2-4 weeks, non-negotiable

### One-on-Ones

*~sitting with one pack member at a time~*

- Weekly or bi-weekly
- Their agenda, not yours
- Listen more than talk
- Ask about blockers
- Ask about feelings, not just tasks

### Team Agreements

Explicit norms reduce friction:

- How do we communicate?
- How do we handle conflict?
- What are core hours?
- How do we handle mistakes?
- What's our definition of done?

## The 10 Principles in Practice

Drawing from Burning Man culture for organizational health:

| Principle | Organizational Application |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Radical Inclusion** | Everyone's voice matters |
| **Gifting** | Help without expectation of return |
| **Decommodification** | Not everything is transactional |
| **Radical Self-reliance** | Own your development |
| **Radical Self-expression** | Bring your whole self |
| **Communal Effort** | Collaboration over competition |
| **Civic Responsibility** | Care for the whole, not just your role |
| **Leaving No Trace** | Clean up your messes |

## Conflict Navigation

Conflict is healthy if handled well:

### Conflict Stages

1. **Latent** — Conditions exist but not surfaced
2. **Perceived** — Parties aware of tension
3. **Felt** — Emotional involvement
4. **Manifest** — Visible conflict behavior
5. **Aftermath** — Resolved or suppressed

### Healthy Conflict Practices

- Name it early (before it festers)
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Separate people from problems
- Seek to understand before being understood
- Look for win-win, not win-lose

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Toxic Positivity
"Everything's great!" when it's not. Denial prevents healing.

### 🚫 The Venting Culture
Endless complaining with no action. Catharsis without change.

### 🚫 The Absent Leader
Manager too busy for 1:1s. People feel invisible.

### 🚫 The Reorganization Addiction
Constant restructuring to "fix" culture. Structure isn't culture.

### 🚫 The Hero Worship
Celebrating overwork. "Sarah worked all weekend!" signals unhealthy norms.

- **Active listening** — Hear what's really being said
- **Powerful questions** — Open, not leading
- **Reframing** — Help see situations differently
- **Holding space** — Be present without fixing
- **Naming patterns** — "I notice this keeps coming up..."
- **Normalizing struggle** — "It's understandable to feel that way"

*~settling into gentle grooming, patient and thorough~*
