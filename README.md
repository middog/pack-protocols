# 🐕 Pack Protocols

**Open frameworks for making fire with your pack.**

This repo contains thinking tools, engagement patterns, and project templates for:
- **mid.dog** — Fractional tech leadership (FIDO) consulting
- **SDCoLab / SDCAP** — Burning Man regional community infrastructure
- **Any pack** trying to move together without burning out

## The Core Insight

Every organization is a living pack.

Some run well. Some run wild. Most run with friction they barely recognize.

These protocols help you **sense the friction**, **name it clearly**, and **design flows that breathe**.

## What's Here

### `/frameworks`
Thinking tools that apply across contexts:

| Framework | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| [Fire Triangle](frameworks/fire-triangle/) | Resources + Enablement + Energy → Momentum |
| [Pack Dynamics](frameworks/pack-dynamics/) | How groups actually move (or don't) |
| [Growth Path](frameworks/growth-path/) | Project → Party → Practice maturation |

### `/templates`
Ready-to-use structures:

| Template | Context |
|----------|---------|
| [mid.dog Project](templates/mid-dog/) | FIDO engagement scoping |
| [CoLab Engagement](templates/colab/) | Community project proposals |

### `/docs`
Extended thinking and background.

## Philosophy

### 🔥 Make Fire, Not Heat

Heat without direction is just friction.
Fire requires **fuel** (resources), **oxygen** (enablement), and **heat** (energy) in balance.

### 🐕 Sense Before You Herd

Dogs don't manage—they sense and respond.
Good leadership reads the pack before issuing commands.

### 🌀 Grow the Spiral

Start small. Prove it works. Let it expand.
Project → Party → Practice.

## Using These Protocols

**For Consulting (mid.dog style):**
1. Use [Pack Dynamics](frameworks/pack-dynamics/) to assess current state
2. Apply [Fire Triangle](frameworks/fire-triangle/) to identify what's missing
3. Scope with [FIDO template](templates/mid-dog/)

**For Community Projects (CoLab style):**
1. Start with [Growth Path](frameworks/growth-path/) to right-size ambition
2. Map resources with [Fire Triangle](frameworks/fire-triangle/)
3. Propose with [CoLab template](templates/colab/)

## The Doggo Ethos

> *"Please state the nature of the dog-related emergency."*

These aren't frameworks for control. They're for:
- **Shepherding** — Guide without dominating
- **Guiding** — Show the path, don't drag
- **Companioning** — Be present, not performative

We range to the call. We don't manufacture crises.
