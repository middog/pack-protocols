# 🐕 Pack Protocols

**Organizational rituals shaped for real flow.**

*~approaches with quiet confidence, tail steady, ready to work~* 🐾

Pack Protocols is a collection of frameworks, templates, and practices for technology consulting and organizational development. Built for the [mid.dog](https://mid.dog) FIDO (Fractional Information & Digital Officer) practice, but useful for anyone doing transformation work.

## The Three Heads of Cerberus

```
                    🐕‍🦺
                 COMPANION
                (Transform)
                    /\
                   /  \
                  /    \
                 /  🔥  \
                /________\
           🐕              🦮
       SHEPHERD          GUIDE
        (vCIO)           (vCTO)
```

| Head | Role | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| **[Shepherd](shepherd/)** | vCIO | Security, compliance, infrastructure hygiene |
| **[Guide](guide/)** | vCTO | Delivery, CI/CD, architecture |
| **[Companion](companion/)** | Change Agent | Adoption, transformation, culture |

Each head guards a different aspect of organizational health. Together, they protect the whole.

## Core Frameworks

| Framework | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **[Fire Triangle](frameworks/fire-triangle/)** | Diagnoses organizational momentum: Fuel + Oxygen + Heat = Fire |
| **[Pack Dynamics](frameworks/pack-dynamics/)** | Reads group state: Running Well → Running Wild → Friction → Stuck |
| **[Growth Path](frameworks/growth-path/)** | Tracks initiative maturity: Project → Party → Practice |

## Philosophy

> **Advisory with presence, not ego.**

The best consultants are like good working dogs: attentive without being anxious, helpful without being performative, present without needing to be the center of attention.

- **Inclusion** — Every voice matters
- **Generosity** — Help without expectation of return
- **Capacity Building** — Build independence, not dependency

- **Collaboration** — Together over solo
- **Stewardship** — Care for the whole system
- **Clean Handoffs** — Good transitions, good documentation
- **Participation** — No spectators; everyone contributes
- **Presence** — Be here now
