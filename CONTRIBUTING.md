# Contributing to Pack Protocols

These frameworks are meant to evolve. Here's how to contribute.

## Philosophy

- **Sharper** — Make distinctions clearer, not mushier
- **Tested** — Share what you've actually used, not just theorized
- **Portable** — Keep frameworks context-agnostic where possible
- **Doggier** — Warm but not soft. Useful but not performative.

## What to Contribute

### ✅ Yes

- Improvements to existing frameworks based on real use
- New templates for specific contexts
- Corrections and clarifications
- Translations
- Case studies (anonymized)

### ❌ No

- Frameworks you haven't actually used
- Proprietary methods you want to open-wash
- Content that doesn't fit the ethos
- AI-generated filler

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b improve-fire-triangle`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test them (use them in real life)
5. Submit a PR with:
   - What you changed
   - Why
   - How you've tested it

## Style Guide

- Markdown only
- Tables for structured comparisons
- Code blocks for templates/examples
- Emoji sparingly (🔥🐕🌀 are canonical)
- No corporate jargon
- Direct, active voice
- One idea per paragraph
