# 🗂️ Practice Management

**Running the Day-to-Day**

*~keeping the den tidy and the tools sharp~* 🐕

Practice Management is the operational backbone: how you organize knowledge, standardize tools, manage capacity, and keep the business running smoothly.

---

## Knowledge Den 📚

Your accumulated wisdom, organized for reuse.

### What to Capture

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Templates** | Proposals, reports, checklists |
| **Playbooks** | How to do common tasks |
| **Case studies** | Past engagements (sanitized) |
| **Tools** | Scripts, utilities, configs |
| **References** | Curated links, docs, courses |

### Organization Principles

- **Findable** — Clear naming, good search
- **Current** — Review and update regularly
- **Reusable** — Generic enough to adapt
- **Versioned** — Know what changed when

### Simple Structure

```
/knowledge
  /templates      # Reusable documents
  /playbooks      # How-to guides
  /tools          # Scripts and utilities
  /references     # External resources
  /case-studies   # Past work examples
```

## Tool Standardization 🔧

Consistent tools reduce cognitive load and increase quality.

### Core Toolkit Categories

| Category | Purpose | Example Tools |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Communication** | Client and team | Slack, Teams, Email |
| **Documents** | Proposals, reports | Google Docs, Word, Markdown |
| **Project tracking** | Tasks, timelines | Asana, Linear, GitHub Projects |
| **Time tracking** | Billing, utilization | Toggl, Harvest, Clockify |
| **Finance** | Invoicing, expenses | Wave, QuickBooks, Xero |
| **Knowledge** | Internal docs | Notion, Obsidian, GitBook |

### Tool Selection Criteria

- Does it solve a real problem?
- Can you actually maintain it?
- Does the client need to access it?
- What's the data portability?
- What's the cost at scale?

### The Minimum Viable Stack

If you're starting out:
- **Email** — Communication
- **Google Workspace** — Documents, calendar
- **Spreadsheet** — Time tracking, simple finance
- **GitHub** — Code, documentation, versioning
- **Bank account** — Separate business finances

Grow tooling as you grow pain points.

## Capacity Sensing 📊

Knowing your limits prevents burnout and missed commitments.

### Capacity Math

```
Available hours/week: 40
- Admin/overhead:     -8
- Business development:-4
- Learning:           -2
= Billable capacity:  26

Sustainable utilization: 70-80%
Target billable hours:   18-21/week
```

### Capacity Planning

| Horizon | Focus | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Week** | What's committed? | Protect time |
| **Month** | What's coming? | Pipeline review |
| **Quarter** | Big picture? | Strategy check |

### Warning Signs

- Consistently > 90% utilization → burnout incoming
- Consistently < 50% utilization → pipeline problem
- All capacity in one client → dependency risk
- No learning time → skill stagnation

---

## Business Rhythms

### Daily

- Check email/messages
- Review today's commitments
- Time tracking

### Weekly

- Pipeline review
- Invoice check
- Week planning
- Learning time

### Monthly

- Financial review
- Capacity assessment
- Knowledge base updates
- Client relationship pulse

### Quarterly

- Strategy review
- Rate evaluation
- Tool assessment
- Professional development

### Annually

- Tax preparation
- Full business review
- Goal setting
- Rate increases

---

## Financial Basics

### Separate Everything

- Dedicated business bank account
- Dedicated business credit card
- Clear personal/business boundary

### Track These

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Revenue | Top line health |
| Expenses | Cost management |
| Profit | Actual earnings |
| Cash flow | Operational health |
| AR aging | Collection health |

### Pricing Reminders

- Raise rates annually (at minimum)
- Value your time properly
- Don't discount without reason
- Scope tightly to avoid scope creep

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Cluttered Den
Knowledge everywhere, nothing findable. Organize ruthlessly.

### 🚫 The Tool Hoarder
New tool for every problem. Stick with what works.

### 🚫 The Capacity Optimist
"I can fit one more thing in." No, you can't.

### 🚫 The Invoice Procrastinator
Waiting weeks to bill. Bill promptly.

### 🚫 The Cobbler's Children
Great work for clients, neglected business. Your practice is a client too.
