# 📈 Growth Patterns

**Solo → Small Pack → Distributed Pack**

*~from lone dog to pack leader~* 🐕→🐕🐕🐕

Growth patterns help you decide if, when, and how to scale your consultancy. Not everyone should grow. But if you do, these patterns help you grow well.

---

## The Growth Decision

### Why Grow?

**Good reasons:**
- More demand than you can serve
- Want to amplify impact
- Team work energizes you
- Financial goals require scale
- Ready to manage people

**Bad reasons:**
- "That's what businesses do"
- Avoiding doing the work yourself
- Status/ego
- Not thinking it through

### Why Stay Small?

**Good reasons:**
- You love the craft
- Management drains you
- Lifestyle fits
- Complexity doesn't appeal
- Margins are better solo

Staying small is valid. Know yourself.

```

## Hiring Principles

### First Hire Considerations

- What do you most need to delegate?
- Senior (expensive, autonomous) vs. junior (cheap, needs mentorship)?
- Specialist (narrow, deep) vs. generalist (broad, flexible)?
- Employee (control, cost) vs. contractor (flexibility, simplicity)?

### Cultural Fit

The first hires set the culture. Choose wisely:
- Do they share your values?
- Can you be in meetings with them?
- Would you trust them with your clients?
- Will they improve the practice?

### Warning Signs

- "I'll figure it out as we go" on key decisions
- Hiring to solve a problem you should solve differently
- Culture mismatch you're ignoring
- Hiring too fast when demand is temporary

---

## The Non-Growth Path

*~contentedly staying in your own territory~*

**Staying solo deliberately is wise if:**
- You have enough
- Management doesn't appeal
- Your work requires your specific skills
- Complexity would reduce joy

**Solo at scale options:**
- Higher rates instead of more hours
- Productized services
- Partnerships without employees
- Referral networks

---

## Transition Patterns

### Solo → Small Pack

1. Identify what to delegate
2. Find first hire/partner
3. Establish minimum process
4. Transfer client relationships carefully
5. Iterate on structure

### Small Pack → Distributed

1. Prove sustainable model with small pack
2. Document processes
3. Build leadership capacity in others
4. Add teams thoughtfully
5. Invest in infrastructure

### Scaling Back

It's okay to shrink:
- Distributed → Small Pack when complexity exceeds joy
- Small Pack → Solo when partnership doesn't work
- Deliberate, not failure

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Premature Scaler
Hiring before demand is proven. Cash crisis incoming.

### 🚫 The Reluctant Manager
Growing but not managing. Quality collapses.

### 🚫 The Culture Denier
"Culture will take care of itself." It won't.

### 🚫 The Status Chaser
Growing for ego, not need. Complexity without value.

### 🚫 The Revenue Splitter
Partnerships without clear agreements. Conflict guaranteed.

*~surveying the growing pack with pride and responsibility~*

**Growth is a choice, not an obligation.** Choose deliberately. Grow thoughtfully. Or stay happily where you are.

*Know your path.* 📈🐕
