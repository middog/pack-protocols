# 🤝 Engagement Lifecycle

**From Sniff to Parting**

*~approaching a new friend with curiosity and care~* 🐕

The engagement lifecycle is the natural rhythm of client relationships: discovering each other, committing to work together, doing the work, and parting well when it's time.

## The Four Phases

```

## Phase 1: SNIFFING 👃

**What:** Mutual discovery. Are we right for each other?

**Activities:**
- Initial conversation
- Understanding their situation
- Sensing pack dynamics
- Assessing fit

**Key Questions:**
- What problem are they actually solving?
- Do I have the skills for this?
- Are they ready for this work?
- Do we work well together?
- Can they pay fair rates?

**Red Flags:**
- Unclear problem definition
- Previous consultant failures with no self-reflection
- Expecting miracles
- Price pressure before understanding value
- Disrespect in initial interactions

**Exit Criteria:**
- Clear enough problem statement
- Mutual interest in proceeding
- No deal-breakers identified

---

## Phase 2: BONDING 🤝

**What:** Formalizing the relationship. Defining the work.

**Activities:**
- Discovery sessions (deep sensing)
- Scope definition
- Proposal writing
- Contract negotiation
- Onboarding

**Deliverables:**
- Discovery findings
- Scope document
- Proposal / Statement of Work
- Signed contract
- Access and logistics setup

**Key Principles:**
- Be specific about scope
- Define what's NOT included
- Clarify communication expectations
- Establish success criteria
- Document assumptions

**Templates:**

## Phase 3: RUNNING 💨

**What:** Doing the work. Delivering value.

**Rhythms:**
| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Check-in | Weekly | Pulse, blockers, priorities |

| Status update | Bi-weekly | Formal progress report |
| Retrospective | Monthly | Process improvement |

**Managing the Engagement:**
- Keep communication channels open
- Surface issues early
- Document decisions

- Celebrate milestones

**Scope Change Protocol:**
1. Identify the change
2. Assess impact (time, cost, quality)
3. Document the request
4. Discuss with client
5. Amend agreement if proceeding
6. Document the decision

## Phase 4: PARTING 👋

**What:** Ending well. Setting up for success without you.

**Activities:**
- Knowledge transfer
- Documentation handoff
- Final deliverables
- Retrospective
- Relationship maintenance

**Parting Well:**
- No surprises—discuss ending early
- Leave them better than you found them
- Document everything
- Introduce successors if applicable
- Ask for feedback
- Stay in touch appropriately

**After Parting:**
- Send thank you
- Request testimonial (if appropriate)
- Add to case studies (with permission)
- Periodic check-ins
- Referral requests (when earned)

## Engagement Health Checks

### Weekly Pulse

| Question | Green | Yellow | Red |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| Are we on track? | Yes | Minor delays | Significant issues |
| Is communication flowing? | Open, regular | Some gaps | Breakdown |
| Are they engaged? | Responsive, involved | Distracted | Absent |
| Am I energized? | Yes | Tired but okay | Dreading it |

### Monthly Review

- Relationship health

## Pricing Models

| Model | Structure | Best For | Risk |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Hourly** | Rate × hours | Uncertain scope | Incentivizes inefficiency |
| **Daily** | Day rate | Embedded work | Same as hourly |
| **Fixed** | Project fee | Clear scope | You absorb overruns |
| **Retainer** | Monthly fee | Ongoing relationship | Underutilization |
| **Value** | Outcome-based | Measurable results | Outcome uncertainty |

### Pricing Tips

- Quote confidently (you're worth it)
- Include buffer for unknowns (15-25%)
- Define payment terms clearly
- Invoice promptly
- Follow up on late payments professionally

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Endless Discovery
Sniffing forever, never committing. At some point, decide.

### 🚫 The Handshake Deal
No written scope. Invites misunderstanding.

### 🚫 The Doormat
Never pushing back. Scope creep, unreasonable demands.

### 🚫 The Ghosting
Ending without proper transition. Damages reputation.

### 🚫 The Clingy Consultant
Creating dependency. Your success is their independence.
