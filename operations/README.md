# ⚙️ Operations

**Running Your Small Technology Consultancy**

*~pacing the territory, keeping everything in order~* 🐕

Operations is the business of running a business. How to find work, scope it, do it well, and grow without losing your soul. These protocols help you build a sustainable consultancy practice.

|---------|-------|-------------|
| [Engagement Lifecycle](engagement-lifecycle/) | Client relationships from sniff to parting | Finding and serving clients |

## The Core Truth

> **A consultancy that burns out its people is not a successful consultancy.**
> **Your reputation is your pipeline.**
> **Independence means owning your failures, not just your wins.**

## The FIDO Business Model

**Fractional Information & Digital Officer**

Three delivery modes:

| Mode | Description | Best For | Investment |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Retainer** | Ongoing hours, flexible allocation | Continuous relationships | Monthly fee |
| **Scoped Project** | Defined deliverables, fixed timeline | Specific outcomes | Project fee |
| **Embedded** | Part-time integration with team | Deep partnership | Day/week rate |

Most engagements blend modes. A retainer might include occasional scoped projects. Embedded work might have retainer support afterward.

## The Doggo Consulting Ethos

### 🐕 Shepherd, Don't Drive
Guide clients toward good outcomes. Don't impose your preferences.

### 🦮 Guide, Don't Drag
Show the path. Let them walk it. Their terrain, their pace.

### 🐕‍🦺 Companion, Don't Perform
Be present and useful. Don't make it about you.

### 🔥 Make Fire, Not Heat
Create sustainable momentum. Activity without outcome is waste.

### 🐾 Range to the Call
Respond when needed. Rest when not. Don't manufacture crises.

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based Thinking

Don't price on time alone. Price on value delivered.

| Engagement Type | Value to Client | Pricing Approach |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Fire fighting | Urgent problem solved | Premium rates |
| Optimization | Efficiency gains | Share in savings |
| Strategy | Better decisions | Fixed fee for deliverable |
| Capacity | Extra hands | Time-based |

### Rate Setting

| Factor | Increases Rate | Decreases Rate |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Expertise | Deep, rare skills | Common skills |
| Urgency | Fire drill | Long timeline |
| Scope | Well-defined | Ambiguous |
| Relationship | New client | Repeat client |
| Geography | High-cost area | Lower-cost area |

---

## Boundaries

Healthy boundaries = sustainable practice.

### Good Boundaries

- "I don't work weekends except for true emergencies"
- "I need 48 hours notice for meetings"
- "That's outside our agreed scope; let's discuss"
- "I'm not available that week"

### Boundary Violations to Watch

- Clients expecting instant responses
- Scope creep without compensation
- Personal time erosion
- Taking on projects you shouldn't
- Working for free to "prove yourself"
