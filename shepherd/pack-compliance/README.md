# 📋 Pack Compliance

**NIST Frameworks & Security Hygiene**

*~sitting at attention, documentation spread before the paws, ready for inspection~* 🐕

Compliance isn't about checking boxes—it's about proving the work is done and done well. The Shepherd documents the territory, demonstrates the controls, and shows the receipts when the auditors come sniffing.

---

## The Core Truth

> **Compliance without security is theater.**
> **Security without documentation is invisible.**
> **The best compliance is security you can prove.**

Pack Compliance bridges the gap between "we're secure" and "we can demonstrate we're secure." It's how you translate your Shepherd work into language auditors, regulators, and customers understand.

---

## Why NIST?

NIST frameworks provide:
- **Common language** — Everyone speaks the same security vocabulary
- **Flexible structure** — Adapt to your organization's risk profile
- **Industry acceptance** — Recognized by regulators, customers, insurers
- **Clear guidance** — Not just "what" but "how"

For small to mid-sized organizations, NIST provides credibility without requiring army-sized compliance teams.

```

### 1. Assess (Gap Analysis)

*~walking the territory, noting what's missing~*

**Objective:** Understand your current state against target framework.

**Activities:**
- Select applicable framework (800-171, CSF, etc.)
- Document current controls
- Identify gaps
- Assess risk of each gap

**Deliverable:** Gap Assessment Report

### 2. Plan (POA&M)

*~drawing the map for remediation~*

**Objective:** Prioritize and schedule remediation.

**Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M):**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Control ID | Which control is deficient |
| Weakness | What's the gap |
| Risk Level | High/Medium/Low impact |
| Remediation | What will we do |
| Resources | Who/what/how much |
| Milestone | When will it be done |
| Status | Not started/In progress/Complete |

**Prioritization factors:**
- Severity of the gap
- Effort to remediate
- Dependencies
- Available resources

### 3. Implement (Controls)

*~building the fences and digging the dens~*

**Objective:** Close the gaps.

**For each control:**
1. Document the implementation approach
2. Deploy technical controls
3. Create/update policies
4. Train affected personnel
5. Document evidence of implementation

### 4. Validate (Audit)

*~demonstrating the work to the inspector~*

**Objective:** Prove controls are working.

**Evidence types:**
- **Screenshots** — Configuration settings
- **Logs** — Event records showing control operation
- **Policies** — Documented procedures
- **Training records** — Attendance, completion certificates
- **Interviews** — Personnel understanding of procedures
- **Technical scans** — Vulnerability reports, config assessments

### 5. Monitor (Continuous)

*~settling into watchful routine~*

**Objective:** Maintain compliance over time.

**Activities:**
- Ongoing control effectiveness monitoring
- Change management for security-relevant changes
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Periodic access reviews
- Annual reassessment

---

## System Security Plan (SSP)

The SSP is your compliance bible—the comprehensive document describing how your security controls are implemented.

### SSP Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **1. System Identification** | System name, owner, boundaries |
| **2. System Description** | Purpose, architecture, components |
| **3. System Environment** | Network diagrams, data flows |
| **4. Control Implementation** | How each control is satisfied |
| **5. Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what |
| **6. Interconnections** | External system connections |
| **7. Policies & Procedures** | Supporting documentation |

### SSP Maintenance

| Activity | Frequency | Trigger |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Minor updates | As needed | Small config changes |
| Section review | Quarterly | Scheduled |
| Full review | Annually | Scheduled |
| Major revision | As needed | Significant system changes, reorg |

## Showing the Work

Compliance is about evidence. Types of evidence Shepherds produce:

### Technical Evidence
- Configuration exports (GPO, Intune profiles)
- Scan results (vulnerability, compliance)
- Log samples (authentication, access)
- Dashboard screenshots (monitoring, status)

### Administrative Evidence
- Policies and procedures
- Training records
- Access approval workflows
- Risk assessment documents

### Physical Evidence (if applicable)
- Access logs (badge readers)
- Visitor registers
- Facility photos
- Equipment inventories

### Interview Records
- Walkthrough notes
- Question/answer documentation
- Process demonstrations

---

## Working with Auditors

*~tail wagging but controlled, maintaining professional composure~*

### Before the Audit

1. **Gather evidence** — Organize by control family
2. **Pre-assess** — Run your own checks first
3. **Brief stakeholders** — Ensure availability
4. **Prepare workspace** — Conference room, network access

### During the Audit

1. **Be honest** — Don't hide gaps; explain remediation plans
2. **Be specific** — Provide evidence, not stories
3. **Take notes** — Document questions and findings
4. **Escalate appropriately** — Know when to involve leadership

### After the Audit

1. **Review findings** — Understand before responding
2. **Accept valid findings** — Don't argue the obvious
3. **Challenge appropriately** — If evidence was missed, provide it
4. **Update POA&M** — Incorporate new findings
5. **Track to closure** — Ensure findings are resolved

---

## Compliance Automation

Don't do compliance manually. Tools that help:

### Compliance Management Platforms
- **Drata** — Automated evidence collection
- **Vanta** — Continuous compliance monitoring
- **Hyperproof** — Compliance workflow management
- **ZenGRC** — Governance, risk, compliance

### Built-in Cloud Tools
- **Microsoft Compliance Manager** — M365/Azure compliance
- **AWS Audit Manager** — AWS compliance assessments
- **GCP Security Command Center** — GCP security posture

### Assessment & Scanning
- **Tenable** — Vulnerability + compliance scanning
- **Qualys** — Cloud security and compliance
- **Chef InSpec** — Compliance as code

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Paper Tiger
Beautiful documentation, no actual controls. Auditors eventually dig deeper.

### 🚫 The Audit Sprint
Scrambling before audits instead of continuous compliance. Exhausting and error-prone.

### 🚫 The Checkbox Shepherd
Implementing controls to pass audits rather than to reduce risk. Missing the point.

### 🚫 The Over-Scoper
Applying every control to every system. Not everything needs maximum security.

### 🚫 The Under-Documenter
Implementing good controls but not documenting. Can't prove what you can't show.

---

## Common Compliance Scenarios

### Scenario: First-Time 800-171 Assessment

*~approaching new territory with careful sniffs~*

1. **Scope the boundary** — What systems handle CUI?
2. **Quick baseline assessment** — Use NIST self-assessment tool
3. **Prioritize high-risk gaps** — Focus on AC, AU, IA, SI first
4. **Create initial SSP** — Even if incomplete
5. **Build POA&M** — Realistic remediation timeline
6. **Implement quick wins** — MFA, patching, logging
7. **Iterate** — Tackle harder controls over time

### Scenario: Continuous Compliance After Initial Certification

1. **Dashboard monitoring** — Control effectiveness metrics
2. **Change management** — Security review of changes
3. **Regular testing** — Quarterly vulnerability scans
4. **Evidence refresh** — Keep documentation current
5. **Annual reassessment** — Full review cycle

---

## Integration Points

- **[Scent Trails](../scent-trails/)** — Asset inventory is compliance requirement #1
- **[Den Security](../den-security/)** — Configuration baselines satisfy many controls
- **[Territory Watch](../territory-watch/)** — Logging proves controls operate
