# 🏠 Den Security

**Workstation & Server Hardening**


Every workstation is a den. Every server is a den. The Shepherd ensures each one is properly secured—not a fortress of paranoia, but a healthy home where work can happen safely.

---

## The Core Truth

> **A secure baseline is a gift to your users.**
> **Consistent configuration is how you scale.**
> **Hardening isn't restriction—it's freedom from worry.**

Good den security means your pack can focus on their work instead of worrying about threats. The Shepherd handles the perimeter so others can rest easy.

---

## Hardening Philosophy

### The Golden Rule of Hardening

**Secure by default. Open by exception. Document everything.**

```
    MAXIMUM SECURITY
          ▲
          │   Too tight = nobody can work
          │   
    ──────┼────── SWEET SPOT ← Secure enough, usable enough
          │   
          │   Too loose = incidents waiting to happen
          ▼
    MAXIMUM USABILITY
```

Finding the sweet spot requires knowing your pack:
- What do they actually need to do their jobs?
- What risks are you actually protecting against?
- What compensating controls exist?

Don't lock the den so tight the pack can't get in and out.

---

## The Belly-Up Assessment 🐕

Before hardening, understand your exposure. The "belly-up" position is vulnerable—that's why dogs only show it to those they trust. Similarly, a vulnerability assessment requires honesty:

| Assessment Area | Questions to Ask |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Physical** | Who can touch this device? Where does it live? |
| **Network** | What can reach it? What can it reach? |
| **Identity** | Who can log in? What privileges do they have? |
| **Data** | What sensitive info does it hold or access? |
| **Application** | What software runs here? What's its attack surface? |

Document your belly-up exposure before applying controls.

## Configuration Baseline Layers

Think of hardening as layers of protection:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              APPLICATION HARDENING                   │
│   (App-specific configs, unnecessary features off)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              SOFTWARE CONTROLS                       │
│   (Approved apps only, no shadow installs)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              IDENTITY & ACCESS                       │
│   (MFA, least privilege, local admin removal)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              NETWORK BOUNDARIES                      │
│   (Firewall, segmentation, traffic filtering)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              OS HARDENING                            │
│   (CIS benchmarks, unnecessary services off)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              HARDWARE/FIRMWARE                       │
│   (Secure boot, TPM, BIOS passwords)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Grooming Session Protocol 🐩

Regular configuration review—like a good brushing that catches tangles before they become mats.

### Weekly Quick Groom
- EDR health check (all agents reporting?)
- Patch compliance snapshot
- Failed login review
- New device enrollment status

### Monthly Deep Groom
- Full baseline compliance scan
- Configuration drift report
- Exception review (are temporary exceptions still needed?)
- Security advisory review

### Quarterly Assessment
- Complete CIS benchmark scan
- Penetration test of sample devices
- Policy effectiveness review
- Tool evaluation

---

## Configuration Management

### Desired State vs. Actual State

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│  DESIRED STATE  │         │  ACTUAL STATE   │
│  (Your policy)  │◀──────▶│  (What's real)  │
└────────┬────────┘         └────────┬────────┘
         │                           │
         │      ┌─────────────┐      │
         └─────▶│    DELTA    │◀─────┘
                │   (Drift)   │
                └──────┬──────┘
                       │
                       ▼
                ┌─────────────┐
                │  REMEDIATE  │
                │  or ACCEPT  │
                └─────────────┘
```

**Tools for managing desired state:**
- **Windows:** Group Policy, Intune Configuration Profiles, DSC
- **macOS:** MDM profiles (Jamf, Intune), scripts
- **Linux:** Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt
- **Cloud:** Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates

### Drift Detection

Configuration drift is natural—like a dog's coat growing out. Detect and remediate:

| Drift Type | Example | Response |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Unauthorized change** | Someone disabled firewall | Alert, investigate, remediate |
| **Natural entropy** | Software update changed defaults | Reapply baseline |
| **Shadow configuration** | Dev installed unauthorized tool | Assess, remove or sanction |
| **Exception creep** | Temporary exception became permanent | Review, close or formalize |

---

## Exception Handling

Sometimes you need to leave a door open. Document it:

### Exception Request Template

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `exception_id` | Unique identifier |
| `requestor` | Who's asking |
| `system_affected` | What device/server |
| `control_bypassed` | Which security control |
| `business_justification` | Why is this needed? |
| `risk_assessment` | What's the exposure? |
| `compensating_controls` | What else protects this? |
| `expiration_date` | When does this end? |
| `approver` | Who approved this? |
| `review_date` | When to re-evaluate |

**Exception life cycle:**
1. Request with justification
2. Risk assessment
3. Identify compensating controls
4. Time-bound approval
5. Implementation with monitoring
6. Regular review
7. Closure or renewal

No permanent exceptions. Everything gets reviewed.

## Common Hardening Frameworks

### CIS Benchmarks
Industry-standard configuration guides for:
- Windows 10/11
- Windows Server
- macOS
- Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.)
- Cloud platforms

**Levels:**
- Level 1: Basic security, minimal impact
- Level 2: Defense-in-depth, may impact usability

### DISA STIGs
Department of Defense Security Technical Implementation Guides. More stringent than CIS. Required for government contractors.

### Microsoft Security Baselines
Microsoft's recommended configurations. Good starting point for Windows environments. Available via Security Compliance Toolkit.

---

## Rollout Strategy

Don't harden everything at once. Pilot, then expand.

```
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │   PILOT GROUP   │ ← 5-10 devices, IT staff
    └────────┬────────┘
             │ Validate, adjust
             ▼
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  EARLY ADOPTERS │ ← Power users, friendly depts
    └────────┬────────┘
             │ Gather feedback, tune
             ▼
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │   BROAD DEPLOY  │ ← Everyone else, in waves
    └────────┬────────┘
             │ Monitor, support
             ▼
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │    STEADY STATE │ ← Continuous compliance
    └─────────────────┘
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 The Fortress Fallacy
Locking down so hard nobody can work. Security that people bypass is no security at all.

### 🚫 The Default Den
Never changing from vendor defaults. Defaults are convenient, not secure.

### 🚫 The One-Size-Fits-All
Same configuration for servers handling public websites and those processing PII. Context matters.

### 🚫 The Config-and-Forget
Applying baseline once and never checking again. Drift happens.

### 🚫 The Exception Explosion
So many exceptions that your baseline is meaningless. If everything's an exception, nothing is secured.

## Integration Points

- **[Scent Trails](../scent-trails/)** — Inventory tells you what to harden
- **[Territory Watch](../territory-watch/)** — Monitoring validates your hardening
- **[Pack Compliance](../pack-compliance/)** — Hardening proves your controls

---


**A well-secured den is a comfortable den.** Your pack sleeps better knowing the Shepherd has checked the locks.

*Rest easy.* 🏠🐕
