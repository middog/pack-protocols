# 🔥 Fire Triangle

**Fuel + Oxygen + Heat → Fire**

A framework for understanding why momentum happens—or doesn't.

---

## The Model

Combustion requires three elements in the right relationship:

```
        FUEL
         /\
        /  \
       / 🔥 \
      /______\
   HEAT      OXYGEN
```

Remove any element → no fire.
Imbalance any element → smoke, not flame.

## The Three Elements

### 🟡 FUEL — Material Resources

**What it is:**
- Physical stuff: space, tools, equipment, materials
- Banked attention: reputation, brand, cultural capital
- Infrastructure: systems that hold and move things

**Signs of missing fuel:**
- "We have great ideas but nowhere to build"
- "Everyone's excited but we can't afford materials"
- "We keep starting over because nothing persists"

**Questions to ask:**
- What physical resources does this need?
- What infrastructure already exists that we can leverage?
- Who "brokers" access to the fuel we need?

---

### 🔵 OXYGEN — Enablement & Flow

**What it is:**
- Logistics: how things actually get done
- Information: what people know and when
- Process: the choreography of coordination
- Clearing: removing blockers to motion

**Signs of missing oxygen:**
- "We have resources but can't coordinate"
- "Everyone's working hard but nothing moves"
- "Left hand doesn't know what right hand is doing"

**Questions to ask:**
- What's blocking flow right now?
- Who knows what—and who doesn't know what they need to?
- What process is missing or broken?

---

### 🔴 HEAT — Energy & Ignition

**What it is:**
- Money: donated, earned, granted
- Time: volunteer hours, attention, presence
- Passion: care, urgency, emotional investment
- Participation: showing up, doing the thing

**Signs of missing heat:**
- "We have everything set up but no one's using it"
- "Great infrastructure, no engagement"
- "Built it, they didn't come"

**Questions to ask:**
- Who cares about this enough to invest?
- Where does the activation energy come from?
- What would make people actually show up?

---

## 🔥 FIRE — Momentum & Culture

When all three elements combine in the right proportion:

**Fuel + Oxygen + Heat → FIRE**

Fire manifests as:
- **Projects** that actually ship
- **Parties** that actually happen
- **Practices** that actually sustain
- **Culture** that actually lives

---

## Diagnostic Use

When something isn't working, ask:

| Symptom | Likely Missing |
|---------|----------------|
| Ideas but no execution | Fuel or Oxygen |
| Resources sitting idle | Heat |
| Burnout and churn | Oxygen (flow is blocked) |
| Lots of activity, no results | Fuel (wrong resources) |
| Everyone busy, nothing ships | Oxygen (coordination) |
| Great plan, no buy-in | Heat (participation) |

## Application Patterns

### For Consulting (FIDO)
Map client's current state:
1. What fuel do they have? (infra, tools, capital)
2. What oxygen do they have? (process, info flow)
3. What heat do they have? (team energy, stakeholder buy-in)
4. Where's the gap?

### For Community Projects (CoLab)
Before proposing:
1. **Fuel:** What space/materials/tools do I need?
2. **Oxygen:** What coordination/permissions/info do I need?
3. **Heat:** Who's actually going to show up and do this?

---

## The "Yes... And!" Principle

When someone brings an idea that doesn't fit your role:

**Don't say:** "No, we can't do that."

**Say:** "Yes, this is great, AND... here's what you'd need to make it happen."

Then help them find:
- The **fuel** (who has resources)
- The **oxygen** (who can enable)
- The **heat** (who will participate)

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 All Fuel, No Fire
"We have a great space but no one uses it."
→ Missing heat (participation) or oxygen (access/awareness)

### 🚫 All Heat, No Fire
"Everyone's passionate but nothing happens."
→ Missing fuel (resources) or oxygen (coordination)

### 🚫 All Oxygen, No Fire
"Great processes, no outcomes."
→ Missing fuel (wrong resources) or heat (no buy-in)

### 🚫 Heroic Firefighting
One person providing all three elements.
→ Unsustainable. Distribute the load.
