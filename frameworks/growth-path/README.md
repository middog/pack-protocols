# 🌀 Growth Path

**Project → Party → Practice**

A framework for right-sizing ambition and scaling what works.

## The Insight

Things grow in stages. Trying to skip stages causes failure.

```
PROJECT  ──🔥──>  PARTY  ──🔥──>  PRACTICE
  │                 │                │
  │                 │                │
  ▼                 ▼                ▼
"Let me try..."  "Let's do..."  "We always..."
```

Each transition requires new **fire** (fuel + oxygen + heat in new proportions).

## The Three Stages

### 🟣 PROJECT — The Experiment

**Energy:** Individual or small team
**Risk:** Low (if it fails, it's a learning)
**Coordination:** Minimal
**Duration:** Bounded

**Sounds like:**
- "I want to try making..."
- "Let's see if this works..."
- "My small team could prototype..."
- "What if we just..."

**What projects need:**
- Space to fail safely
- Minimal bureaucracy
- Access to basic resources
- Permission (explicit or implicit)

**Success looks like:**
- Something exists that didn't before
- At least one person cared enough to finish
- Learning happened (even if outcome was "no")

---

### 🟢 PARTY — The Coordinated Event

**Energy:** Group participation required
**Risk:** Moderate (reputation, resources at stake)
**Coordination:** Significant
**Duration:** Bounded but planned

**Sounds like:**
- "Let's host a..."
- "Everyone should come to..."
- "We need to coordinate with..."
- "Let's make this a thing..."

**What parties need:**
- Logistics and planning
- Promotion and communication
- Risk mitigation (safety, liability)
- Multiple people committed to showing up

**Success looks like:**
- People came
- The thing happened as planned (mostly)
- Energy generated, not just consumed
- "We should do this again"

---

### 🔴 PRACTICE — The Ongoing Institution

**Energy:** Sustainable and regenerating
**Risk:** High (organizational commitment)
**Coordination:** Systematic
**Duration:** Indefinite

**Sounds like:**
- "We should always..."
- "This should be a department..."
- "Every year we..."
- "It's just what we do..."

**What practices need:**
- Governance and ownership
- Sustainable funding model
- Documentation and succession
- Integration with larger org

**Success looks like:**
- Continues without the founder
- Has its own rhythm and renewal
- Creates capacity, not just output
- Part of organizational identity

## Transition Points

### 🔥 Project → Party

**Triggers:**
- "More people want in than we can handle informally"
- "This is too good to keep small"
- "We need to coordinate with others"

**What changes:**
- Individual energy → Group coordination
- Informal → Planned
- "My thing" → "Our thing"

**What's needed:**
- Someone willing to coordinate (not just create)
- Logistical capacity
- Clear invitation to participate

**Risks:**
- Losing the spark by over-formalizing
- Creator burnout if they become coordinator
- Scaling before proving

---

### 🔥 Party → Practice

**Triggers:**
- "We do this every time anyway"
- "This should be official"
- "We need sustainable structure"

**What changes:**
- Event → Institution
- Volunteers → Roles
- Reputation → Mandate

**What's needed:**
- Governance structure
- Funding model
- Succession planning
- Organizational buy-in

**Risks:**
- Bureaucracy killing energy
- Institution outliving purpose
- Founders unable to let go

---

## Not Everything Should Grow

Critical insight: **Growth is not always good.**

**Some things should stay projects:**
- One-time experiments
- Personal expressions
- Things that lose magic at scale

**Some things should stay parties:**
- Annual traditions
- Community rituals
- Things that work at current scale

**Questions before growing:**
- Does this *need* to be bigger?
- Who's asking for growth? (them or you?)
- What gets lost at the next stage?
- Is there capacity for the next stage?

---

## Regression Is Okay

Practices can scale back to parties.
Parties can scale back to projects.
This isn't failure—it's adaptation.

**Signs it's time to scale down:**
- Energy depleted, not renewed
- Going through motions
- Resentment instead of enthusiasm
- "We have to" instead of "We want to"

**How to scale down gracefully:**
- Name it explicitly ("We're simplifying")
- Celebrate what was, don't mourn
- Give permission to let go
- Preserve the seed for future growth

## Mapping Your Landscape

Audit your current initiatives:

| Initiative | Current Stage | Right Stage? | Next Move |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| ... | Project/Party/Practice | Yes/No | Grow/Maintain/Shrink |

**For each one, ask:**
1. What stage is it actually at?
2. Is that the right stage for now?
3. What would growing require?
4. What would shrinking free up?

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 Premature Scaling
"Let's make this a program!" (before proving it works)
→ Build bureaucracy for something that might not matter.

### 🚫 Stuck at Project
Great ideas that never coordinate.
→ Individual heroics instead of collective capacity.

### 🚫 Zombie Practices
Institutions that outlive their purpose.
→ Energy sink. Let them die with dignity.

### 🚫 Forced Growth
"This should be bigger" (says who?)
→ Scaling for ego, not need.
