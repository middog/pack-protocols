# 🐕 Pack Dynamics

**How groups actually move—or don't.**

A framework for sensing organizational state before trying to change it.

---

## The Insight

Every organization is a living pack.

Packs aren't machines. They don't respond to commands—they respond to **signals**, **scent trails**, and **social dynamics**.

Before you try to lead, you have to **sense**.

---

## Pack States

### 🟢 Running Well
**Signs:**
- Rhythm is steady and sustainable
- People know their roles without constant clarification
- Information flows to where it's needed
- Friction is named and addressed, not festering
- Energy replenishes faster than it depletes

**Your role:** Stay out of the way. Observe. Maintain.

---

### 🟡 Running Wild
**Signs:**
- High energy, low direction
- Everyone's busy, outcomes unclear
- Multiple competing priorities
- Lots of starting, not much finishing
- Excitement masks exhaustion

**Your role:** Slow down. Focus. Create finish lines.

---

### 🔴 Running with Friction
**Signs:**
- Motion is effortful
- Same problems keep recurring
- Workarounds have become "the process"
- People avoid certain topics/people/systems
- Friction is normalized ("that's just how it is")

**Your role:** Name it. Trace root causes. Design for flow.

---

### ⚫ Stuck
**Signs:**
- Energy is depleted
- Learned helplessness
- "We've tried everything"
- High turnover or disengagement
- Survival mode

**Your role:** Triage. Quick wins. Restore hope before strategy.

## Sensing Before Herding

Dogs don't manage—they **sense and respond**.

Before intervening, ask:

### Scent Trails
- Where does work actually flow? (vs. where the org chart says)
- Who do people actually go to for answers?
- What are the informal communication channels?

### Pack Position
- Who's leading? Who thinks they're leading?
- Where are the tensions between formal and informal authority?
- Who's the "alpha" in practice vs. title?

### Energy Patterns
- Where's the energy? Where's the drain?
- What activities generate momentum vs. consume it?
- When do people light up? When do they shut down?

### Territory
- What does each group "own"?
- Where are the boundaries unclear or contested?
- What happens when territories overlap?

---

## Intervention Principles

### 🐕 Shepherd, Don't Drive
- Guide from the side, not from behind with a whip
- Use presence, not force
- Redirect energy, don't try to create it

### 🦮 Guide, Don't Drag
- Show the path, let them walk it
- Remove obstacles instead of pushing through
- Trust they know more about their terrain than you do

### 🐕‍🦺 Companion, Don't Perform
- Be present without needing to be the hero
- Support capacity, don't create dependency
- Your success is their independence

---

## Reading Resistance

When the pack pushes back:

| Resistance Type | What It Signals | Response |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Silence | Fear or disengagement | Safety first. Ask, don't tell. |
| Cynicism | Past betrayals | Acknowledge history. Small promises, kept. |
| Busy-ness | Avoidance or overload | Reduce before adding. |
| "We tried that" | Pattern recognition | Ask what was different then. |
| Enthusiasm | Buy-in OR appeasement | Test with small commitments. |

## Pack Archetypes

Common roles you'll encounter:

### The Alpha (Formal)
Positional leader. May or may not have actual influence.
**Engage:** Respect position while sensing actual authority.

### The Alpha (Informal)
Who people actually follow.
**Engage:** Critical ally. Get them early or get resistance.

### The Scout
First to try new things. Takes risks.
**Engage:** Perfect for pilots. Give them room to explore.

### The Guardian
Protects the pack from threats (real and perceived).
**Engage:** Address their fears directly. They're often right.

### The Connector
Knows everyone. Moves information across silos.
**Engage:** Essential for understanding actual flows.

### The Skeptic
Questions everything. Often labeled "difficult."
**Engage:** Often the best diagnostic. Ask what they see.

### The Quiet Carrier
Does the actual work. Rarely credited.
**Engage:** Find them. Acknowledge them. They know everything.

## Anti-Patterns

### 🚫 Herding Cats
Trying to impose pack dynamics on a group that isn't one.
→ Not every group is a pack. Some are networks. Some are crowds.

### 🚫 The Hero Dog
Coming in to save the pack single-handedly.
→ You'll burn out. They'll resent it. Build capacity, not dependency.

### 🚫 Ignoring the Informal
Only engaging formal structure.
→ Formal structure is the map. Informal structure is the territory.

### 🚫 Moving Too Fast
Trying to change the pack before sensing it.
→ You'll trigger immune responses. Observe first. Earn trust.

## Diagnostic Questions

Use these in discovery:

1. "Walk me through how [X] actually gets done."
2. "Who would you go to if you needed [Y]?"
3. "What's the thing everyone knows but nobody says?"
4. "What's working that we should protect?"
5. "If you could change one thing tomorrow, what would it be?"
6. "What have you tried before? What happened?"
