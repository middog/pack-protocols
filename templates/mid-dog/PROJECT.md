## 5. Principles

*How we work:*

### 🐕 Shepherd, Don't Drive
We guide from the side. We redirect energy rather than manufacture it.

### 🦮 Guide, Don't Drag
We show the path. We trust you know your terrain.

### 🐕‍🦺 Companion, Don't Perform
We're present without needing to be the hero. Your success is your independence.

### 🔥 Make Fire, Not Heat
Heat without direction is friction. We build for sustainable momentum.
