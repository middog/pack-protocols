# CoLab Engagement Templates

Templates for proposing and running community projects at SDCoLab / SDCAP.

## Files

- [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) — Project proposal template
- [RETROSPECTIVE.md](RETROSPECTIVE.md) — Post-project reflection

## The Three Entities

| Entity | Role | What They Provide |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **SDCoLab** | FUEL | Space, materials, tools, infrastructure |
| **SDCAP** | OXYGEN | Logistics, coordination, enablement, grants |
| **Community** | HEAT | Time, money, passion, participation |

## How to Propose

1. **Assess your stage** — Is this a project, party, or practice?
2. **Map the fire triangle** — What fuel, oxygen, and heat do you need?
3. **Fill out the proposal** — Be honest about capacity and gaps
4. **Submit** — [process TBD]

## The "Yes... And!" Principle

SDCAP and CoLab exist to **enable**, not to **own**.

If your proposal doesn't fit their current capacity, expect:
- "Yes, this is great, AND here's how you could run it yourself"
- "Yes, we want to support this, AND here's what we can offer"

Never just "no." Always "yes, and here's the path."

## What CoLab Is NOT

- Storage rental
- Venue for non-community activities  
- Property management

## What SDCAP Is NOT

- Community overseer
- Owner of initiatives
- Authority for what can/cannot be done
